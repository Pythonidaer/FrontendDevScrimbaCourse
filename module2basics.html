- Watch out for tutorial hell
- Basic HTML and CSS (basic structure and syntax)
- HyperText Markup Language: the content of websites
- Cascading Style Sheets: how our websites look
- and JavaScript (building blocks of the web)
    - Programming language that manipulates HTML and CSS
    - Used for simple manipulations to create full web apps

HTML:
- Tells the browser what the content you're writing actually is
- "Heading or a regular paragraph?":
    - Like a book that has chapters, titles, sections, bold words, etc.
- A link, bold, or italic text
- A navigation, footer, the main content of the page
- Wraps everything in 'tags' to tell the browser what is what: <html> </html>
    - Opening and closing tag all together gives us an element
    - <page>
        <heading>Chapter 3</heading>
        <subheading>The darkness</subheading>
        <p>The clouds start rolling in.</p>
    - </page>
- <!DOCTYPE html>
        - The very first thing at the top of the document
        - Tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document
- <html>
        - Telling the browser we're starting to write HTML
        - Might seem redundant, but think of <style> and <script>
        - Acts as the "root" of our document
- <head>
        - Nothing here is visible to the visitor (except <title>)
        - Contains essential information (like meta tags)
        - More like a brain than a head
    - <title>
            - In the head of the document
            - Shows up in the tab of the browser and in search results
- <body>
        - Contains the content that will be visible to the user when they visit a page
        - Headings denote hierarchy and page structure
            - Six levels of headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>)
                - generally one <h1> per page
                - <h1>
                - <h2>
                - <p>
                - <h2>
                - <p>
        - Paragraphs are your regular text: <p>
                - <h#> and <p> are block elements
- <strong>
        - Indicates that it is of strong importance 
        - Browsers make this text bold
        - Semantically more important than other text
- <em>
        - Short for emphasis
        - Browsers make this text italic
        - <strong> and <em> are inline elements: we use them within a paragraph
             - We must close a strong or em tag before the end of our paragraph
    

File Organization:
            - Staying organized is very important
            - File names are very important
            - Keep file names short
            - Should be descriptive (e.g. "page2.html vs. about-us.html")
            - No spaces, use underscores or hyphens instead _, -
            - Use lower case ("About-Us.html" vs. "about-us.html")
            - The main folder is called our root folder
            - The homepage must be index.html
            - index.html must be in the root folder, and not a sub-folder
            - Other pages can be in subfolders, depending on how you want to stay organized
            - Images should be placed in a sub folder for better organization

Anchors and Attributes:
            - <a> = anchor
                - Used to link either to a different location with the current ot to another page
            - The word google here is a link somewhere can click on... but how does the browser know where to link to?
                - Attributes! = are always within the opening tag
                - Attributes give extra info to the browser about the element, such as where a link goes, or the location of an image file
                - Normally followed by an equal sign and quotation marks
                    - href="https://google.com" within <a> not </a>
            - A link won't work without an href attribute
            - ABSOLUTE PATH - if the page you are linking to is NOT part of your website, it MUST start with:
                - http:// or https:// = to let the browser know that it is an external site that you are linking to
                    - <a href="https://google.com">google</a>
            - RELATIVE PATH - you can link to other pages within your site by siomply putting their file name
                    - <a href="about-us.html" or <a href="team/john.html">

Going to have a bunch of challenges at the end.
Said it's okay to skip if I'm already well versed in this all.
